# In-His-Prime
Once, on my grandson’s birthday, I asked him the following five questions:
1. How many days are there in this month?
2. How many Mondays are there in this month?
3. How many “prime” days (ie, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, . . . ) are there in this month?
4. How many of those prime days are Saturdays?
5. How many letters are there when you spell the month?

The total of the five answers was a prime number. Then I asked him the same questions the next day. No answer was the same as for the day before, but again the total of the five answers was prime. When I first asked the questions **what was the month and day of the week?**

The answer given by the newspaper was February, Monday or Friday

## Prolog programming
I used Prolog language to solve this problem and printed the answer [[2,29,1],[3,31,2]]. After pressing NEXT, it should print [[2,29,5],[3,31,6]]. Or perhaps these are printed the other way around. Either way, after pressing NEXT again, it should print nothing more. The two correct answers may then be read off directly — in a 29-day month, the start day and the finish day are the same.
